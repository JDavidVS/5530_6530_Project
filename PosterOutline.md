## Background

For digital signal processing, frequency selective filters play a crucial role. These filters can help reduce specific frequency components of the signals. Two of these filters are the nulling filter, which is designed to suppress unwanted frequencies, and the bandpass filter, which isolates a specific range of frequencies to allow.

Traditional methods of implementing these filters often encounter limitations. Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters emerge as a robust alternative, offering distinct advantages in both nulling and bandpass applications. In speech signal processing, bandpass FIR filters isolate the frequencies pertinent to human speech, enhancing clarity and intelligibility. Meanwhile, nulling FIR filters suppress noise and interference.

## Introduction

Our project explores various applications for Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters. We have focused on their behavior as nulling filters and bandpass filters for discrete signals.
