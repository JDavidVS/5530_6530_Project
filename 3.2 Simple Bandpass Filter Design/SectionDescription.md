# 3.2 - Simple Bandpass Filter Design

Simple Bandpass Filter in audio processing allows a specific range of frequencies to pass through while attenuating others.It's characterized by a center frequency and bandwidth.
Graphical representations depict frequency response. It's crucial for shaping and manipulating audio signals in various applications.In our MATLAB-based experiment, we have observed that applying the filter results in a decrease or elimination of frequencies. However, the middle frequency is an exception and remains unaffected, while the others are either reduced or removed. The input and equation utilized in our experiment yield the following outcomes:
