# 3.2 - Simple Bandpass Filter Design
## L-Point Averaging Filter

The L-point averaging filter is a lowpass filter. Its passband width is controlled by `L`, being inversely proportional to `L`. You can use the GUI `dltidemo` to view the frequency response for different averagers and measure the passband widths.

It is also possible to create a filter whose passband is centered around some frequency other than zero. One simple way to do this is to define the impulse response of an L-point FIR as:
