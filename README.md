## Frequency Response of FIR Filters

The frequency response function for FIR filters is introduced. The magnitude and phase versus frequency govern the response of sinusoidal input signals through the filter. Thus frequency-selective filtering is possible, and the running average filter is shown to be a lowpass filter.
